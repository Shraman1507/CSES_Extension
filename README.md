# CSES Companion: Your Ultimate Competitive Programming Ally

**CSES Companion** is a powerful Chrome extension designed to supercharge your experience on the [CSES](https://cses.fi/problemset/) platform. It seamlessly integrates a professional-grade code editor and a suite of productivity tools directly into the CSES problem pages, allowing you to focus on what matters most: solving problems.

## üöÄ Core Features

*   **Integrated Monaco Editor**: Enjoy the same coding experience as VS Code with a full-featured editor, including syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and theme support, right on the problem page.
*   **One-Click Automatic Submission**: Say goodbye to manual file uploads. The "Submit" button automatically sends your code to the judge in the correct format.
*   **Instant Local Testing**: Run your code against sample test cases with a single click and see the results instantly, without leaving the page.
*   **Efficient Template Management**: Create, save, and quickly insert your boilerplate code templates for any supported language (C++, Java, Python).
*   **Persistent Preferences**: The extension remembers your preferred language, font size, and code for each problem, so you can pick up right where you left off.
*   **Automatic Code Saving**: Never lose your work. Your code is automatically saved locally as you type.
